## About me

**Economist | Data analyst**

Hi, I am **Jesus L. Monroy**. I have a master's in **Information Technologies** and a bachelor's in **Economics**. I am studying **Machine Learning** as well.

I have worked in whole data life cycle (collection, storage, processing, analysis, and deployment) in government **intelligence**, but also in **e-commerce**, **finance** and **healthcare** businesses.

The main tools I have used are spreadsheets, **SQL** and **Python** (Numpy, Pandas, Polars, SQLAlchemy, Seaborn, Altair, Plotly, Folium, Duckdb, Sckit-Learn). I have also used **Tableau**, **Looker Studio** and **Power BI** to create dashboards and APIs like **Datawrapper,** Google (Big Query, Analytics, Drive, Sheets), and **Mega**. I am currently studying Machine Learning.

My hobbies are reading, exercising and play with my dogs. I am vegan and I invite you to join us.

I am open to a position in a data-driven setting to use my skills on SQL and Python to create value from data in order to support business decision making.

## Projects

I present some brief examples of diverses projects I have done about connecting to databases to create data pipelines, data cleansing and visualizations.
