## About me

**Economist | Data analyst**

I use tools like **SQL**, **Python**, **Tableau** and **Google apps** to collect, cleanse, transform, analyze and deploy insights from diverse data sources. I have experience in **public security**, **e-commerce**, and **healthcare**.

I hold a master's of **Information Technology** and bachelor's of **Economics.** I'll soon start on a machine learning certification. I like reading, writing, exercising, and playing with my dogs.

My methodology is using data to identify incentives that move people among diverse 
altenatives, so we can solve problems derived from social interactions.

I'm committed to using my skills to create positive change in the world.

I'm vegan and I invite you to join us.

## Objective

To create data products that support business decision-making by applying my skills in SQL and Python.
